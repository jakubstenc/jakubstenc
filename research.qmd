Who are the pollinators of wild plants? What are the global patterns in plant-pollinator interactions? What does shape the composition of pollinator spectra?

That's principal questions which are surprisingly still largely unanswered. And I would like to answer them.

So far, we focused on

-   The majority of plants had either muscid-, hoverfly- or nitidulid-dominated or completely generalised pollinator spectra. Among such plants, higher local dominance increased the proportion of opportune muscids in pollinator spectrum, while hoverflies showed the opposite pattern. Honeybees although rather infrequent in pollinator spectra also showed a strong preference for locally dominant plant species.

-   *Synthesis*: The composition of a plant's pollinator spectrum is not independent of other aspects of the plant's life history, namely niche width and the ability to dominate the community. Wider plant species niches result in more generalised pollinator spectra, supporting our hypothesis that habitat generalists are less prone to specialisation on particular pollinator groups. Conversely, the ability to dominate local plant communities influenced pollinator spectra mainly through specific responses of individual pollinator groups.

## Pollen transfer

How is pollen transferred? How much pollen grains is successfully delivered to stigma? And how much is lost to reproduction forever?

These are the questions I am interested to investigate. In recent years, we focused with my collaborators on the pattern of pollen release from flowers. We found out that plants may time the release of the pollen, which then affects timing of the plant-pollinator interaction, structuring the plant-pollinator network.

## Pollinator sharing among plants

Plants usually share multiple pollinators. But how that affects pollen transfer? How can plants co-exist? Does they somehow mitigate the heterospecific pollen transfer?

This is the topic I would like to focus in following years, during my post-doc in Barcelona.

Currently, the following topics for bachelor's and master's thesis are available:

-   [The mechanisms affecting heterospecific pollen transfer and the influence on long-term plant co-existence](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/dipl_st/index.php?id=&tid=&do=main&doo=detail&did=279151)

-   [The effect of floral traits on pollinator sharing between plants](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/dipl_st/index.php?id=&tid=&do=main&doo=detail&did=279151)

## Pollinator behaviour

How does colour, size and shape of the flowers affect pollinator decision to visit flower? How does these traits affect pollinator constancy?

To study pollinator behaviour, we use both artificial flowers (made on 3D printer) and real flowers. We then present them to pollinators and record their decision. Currently we studied hoverfly Eristalis tenax, which is possible to breed and thus find difference between naive and experienced individuals.

You can read more about preferences toward different flower traits in our article:

Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 140(1), 110--119. <https://doi.org/10.1093/BIOLINNEAN/BLAD035>
